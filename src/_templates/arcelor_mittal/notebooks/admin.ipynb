    "Via the URLs of Prysent, you can actually execute a couple of commands that are not visible because they are simply not linked in the menu.  And they are not linked in the menu because the users should not execute them.  They were used during development but they remain accessible for an administrator because also for him/her these commands can be useful in case of trouble(shooting).\n",

The actual command is running in a separate thread and thus in the background on the server.  The final results can take a while (for instance when you trigger the update of all scheduled notebooks) and there's **no notification** when the command fully executed."

    "- Removes all the cached pages from the database: any page that is not scheduled but kept in cache, is removed.  Note that caching for the scheduled pages is not kept in the same table as the caching for the non-scheduled notebooks.\n",
    "- Resets the next run for the scheduled notebooks to 'now': all the scheduled notebooks are in a table and the next rendering of the notebook is kept in a field.  This field is reset to 'now', meaning that the next time the scheduler runs (normally each 5 minutes) or the first time the notebook is viewed by a user, this notebook will be rendered again.\n",
